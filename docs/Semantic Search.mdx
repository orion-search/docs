For long-text queries, Orion finds semantically similar publications by making vector-based comparisons at scale. Here is how it works:

- [Infer a document vector](https://docs.orion-search.org/docs/Operators#text2sentencebertoperator) for every paper abstract in the database using a sentence-level DistilBERT model.
- [Build a Faiss index](https://docs.orion-search.org/docs/Operators#faissindexoperator) with the document vectors.
- For every new, long-text query:
  - Infer its vector representation with the same sentence-level DistilBERT model.
  - Use the pre-built Faiss index for similarity matching and return the most relevant results.
