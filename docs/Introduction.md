Orion is an open source platform to measure progress in research and organise scientific knowledge. 

Orion has three distinct components:

- [A data collection, analysis and enrichment pipeline for scientific documents](https://github.com/orion-search/orion) from Microsoft Academic Graph.
- A [web-interface](https://github.com/orion-search/orion-search.org) with interactive data visualisations.
- A [search engine](https://github.com/orion-search/search-engine) for keyword and vector-based searches.

You can combine these components to develop an application (see [Use Cases](https://docs.orion-search.org/docs/Use%20Cases)) or use Orion's data pipeline for science of science projects.

You can find Orion on [GitHub](https://github.com/orion-search).

## Principles ##

- **Dynamic:** Reconfigure Orion's data pipeline to collect and analyse the scientific documents of your choice.
- **Modular:** Add or remove Orion's data pipeline before running it.
- **Flexible**: Make scientific knowledge explorable with variable length text queries and interactive data visualisations.
