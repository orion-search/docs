## [bioRxiv deployment](https://www.orion-search.org/) ##

We collected all the papers published in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/). **This is the main deployment of Orion.** It showcases all of Orion's components.

## [Collective Intelligence deployment](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project-updates/ai-ci-researchmapping/) ##

We used Orion's ETL to collect all the publications on collective intelligence and AI (machine learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning) that were published between 2000 and 2020. We mapped the research trends at the nexus of the two fields.

## [ACL deployment](https://github.com/kstathou/acl-search-engine) ##

Ahead of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2020, we developed a prototype to visually explore and search for publications that have been presented at the conference between 2000 and 2020. We used Orion's ETL to collect the scientific documents and develop a vector-based search engine. [[Video](https://youtu.be/WuBZu8KeMFw)]

## [Misinformation deployment](http://misinformationresearchexplorer-env.eba-e5m9nipt.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/) ##

We used Orion's ETL to collect the publications that were published between 2000 and 2020 and had misinformation, disinformation or fake news as a field of study. We used that data to analyse the misinformation research landscape. The findings were included in Nesta's report on **[Mapping the News, Media and Journalism Landscape](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/mapping-news-media-and-journalism-landscape-research-report/)** and we also presented the findings at the [IC2S2](https://youtu.be/AqpSrKDctos).
