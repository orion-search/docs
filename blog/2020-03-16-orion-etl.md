Orion has three main components; a data pipeline that includes the processes that collect and analyse research data, a search engine and a data visualisation layer. In this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@kstathou/a-walkthrough-of-orions-backend-data-and-design-decisions-f60c01b507aa), I discuss Orion’s ETL as well as some important data and design choices.
